# DaemonGame
Javascript game based on Maxwell's Daemon

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon

The Daemon overlooks a closed thermodynamic system. By opening and closing a partition in the center of the system, the daemon is able to eventually lower the entropy of the system. Click the mouse anywhere to toggle the partition wall on or off. Here the task is to tactically toggle the partition on and off to separate the blue and red objects onto different sides of the system.

NB: The Entropy calculation is currently not functional, it is a placeholder.

Proposed additions:
Intro menu/options screen
 - select number of agents (4 - 10?)
 - select size of partition
 - select number of moves (limited number or infinite)
Proper entropy calculation
Ability to pause/slow down time
